# SafeVision 🔍🚨

**Real-time Violence Detection System Using Deep Learning**

SafeVision is a real-time crowd surveillance system designed to detect violent behavior in video footage using deep learning models. The goal is to assist in public safety monitoring by automatically flagging potential violent actions for rapid response.

---

## 💡 Motivation

In high-density public environments, human surveillance can be error-prone and slow. SafeVision aims to enhance safety by combining video processing, deep learning, and alert mechanisms to detect violent actions as they occur.
